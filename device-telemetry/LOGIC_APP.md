# Logic App

LogicApps are a managed service that provides the Lego blocks of Azure serverless architecture that you can use to create, develop and deploy cloud-based integrations 
and workflows. The developer merely strings together off-the-self, ready-made components with as little effort as possible. The aim is to go from development to production 
in a few simple, reproducible steps. Microsoft are investing strongly in this technology, introducing many new connectors in line with the demands of the integration requirements of enterprises.

## Use Case
